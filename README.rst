Elijah Fluffy Umbrella
=======================

* It bothers me slighly that this name is not unique. But what is?

This is the source code for the read the docs site at :doc:`<https://elijah-lang-notes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__.
It is for the vaporware/experimental and never finished "compiler" project :doc:`Elijah <https://github.com/elijah-team/fluffy-umbrella/>`__. 

This site helped me alot more than the read the docs tutorial:

2022-10 (October 2022) Plan
============================

*Oct 01 00:00*

Get back to something that works and continue from there.

- Testability

  * Don't be afraid of breaking the build

    1. It's broke anyway, so what the heck!

  * Find a testing framework

    1. JUnit and Mockito/Easymock work well enough, but I feel like ther's more to life...
    2. The point, though, is to know when "it works"

- HTML Generation

  * What is the difference between a web server and Glamorous Toolkit?

    1. AJAX. Yeah, seen it coming.
    2. I could not figure out GWT. Neither could anyone else.

  * Side by side results

    1. Let's see what we are getting/it is doing

- Generate results

  * Hopefully POC by Dec 1

    1. Maybe I should figure out what the hell this entails...

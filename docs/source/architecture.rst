Architecture
=============

*Oct 01 00:00*

1. Make some things less explicit
  * Mostly irrelevant stuff like setup

2. Make other things more explicit
  * More relevant stuff like core functionality

3. Make managable chunks

4. Pull code from net
  * Like Go (or that other thing...)
  * Almost hate git, almost like Darcs

- Also, at some point I should learn what the difference is between an AST and a parse tree.
  I think if I would have known this, *everything* would have been different.

  There it is, elementary school teachers. Honestly, I forgot which grade.

- Immutability of source representation is for programming in the large, not small examples

Principles
-----------
* Generators
  - Do stuff
* Buffers
  - Hold stuff
* Web
  - Interact/display stuff

Stages/Phases
--------------
* Begin (Setup)
* Parse
* "Generate" (confusing name)
* Deduce
* Generate outputs
* Fin (`Conquer World! <https://discourse.nixos.org/t/carbon-lang-an-opportunity-for-the-nix-codebase/20536/3>`)

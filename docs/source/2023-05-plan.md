========================

*May 27 1306*

This is based on findings and work since January.

- Testability

 * EG_Statement
   
   1. There is substantial work supporting this.  Eventually this pattern will 
   prevail over the whole project and integration with `Buffer`s will be 
   (re)introduced.

   2. The testing aspect of this has to come later, as there is not sufficient
   reach present now.]

- HTML Generation

 * Lay the foundation for this, but don't try to implement yet

   1. `UT_Controller`, etc was the start of this line, but was not continued 
   due to branch hopping.

- Generate results

 * Self imposed deadline by Aug 1, 2023
   
   1. All examples should generate working and correct C and (Meson) makefiles.
   
   2. Are We Fast Yet should be included.

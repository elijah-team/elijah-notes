Programming Experience
=======================

It is meant to describe how a programmer should approach and what to expect from using **Elijah**.

This is a design goal that needs to be set for the new year/next sprint. (aka what the hell is this?)(aka why don't you use xtext and go to bed?)

"Historical curiosity" does not make as much sense as it might seem to on bleeding edge distro.

The (lack of) rst plugin is very interesting.

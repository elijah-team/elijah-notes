2022-12 (December 2022) Plan
=============================

*Dec 29 1903*

This is the plan I came up with for December in November, in and out of consciousness.
Things don't always go as planned, even when you plan them...

- Testability

 * EG_Statement
   
   1. Don't be afraid of breaking the build.

     See `Not wasting time with version control by Cal Paterson <https://calpaterson.com/wasting-time.html>`__

     I like to make my commits in a way where none actually cause the compiler to throw an error, and each one 
     theoretically can be reordered or, in the case of micro-commits, they are part of a series, and replaying
     that series get to a "goal".

     The goal of the goal (`goals everywhere <https://medium.com/codex/5-harsh-truths-from-linus-torvalds-406ab20cea02>`__)
     is that I don't even look at git until I get a clean build (usually).

 * IDeduceElement3 (as you will)
 * CReference.for...

 * Find a testing framework

   It was advised by magic fairies not to worry about this.

   I say if you cant get it done with JUnit and Cucumber, you're doing something wrong.

   Then again, is it Scalatest? has a really nice syntax. One of them, I'm not sure.

- HTML Generation

 * Lay the foundation for this, but don't try to implement yet

- Generate results

 * Hopefully POC by Jan 15
   
   1. I got thrown off schedule by about 45 days, so extend "deadline" by about 45 days

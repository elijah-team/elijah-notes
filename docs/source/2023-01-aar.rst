2023-01 January After Action Report
====================================

Ok. It's January 16. And I finally (almost) met a goal.

I transcribed the things I could find from November and did what I could to put them togerther.
There was some distraction from random NPEs and things like that, which showed up when they weren't wanted.

* Alot of dead code remoal, especially in Compilation, which seems like it needs to slim down a little more

* Beginning to remove PipelineLogic, which is a step in the right direction to rmoeing Pipelines (and replacing then with Queries)

* Add new test in while100
